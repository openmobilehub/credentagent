// @openmobilehub/credentagent-gate — public types (the contract, in TypeScript).
//
// Two layers (see specs/001-attesto-sdk/data-model.md):
//   • policy   — code: builders carry functions (.when / verify / appliesTo) and live in your server.
//   • manifest — data: `requirements()` resolves the policy server-side and emits a flat, JSON-safe
//                manifest. Functions NEVER cross the wire. `requirements()` is that code→data boundary.
